"Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members
of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least
daily - leading to multiple integrations per day.
Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect
integration errors as quickly as possible.
Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems
and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.
This article is a quick overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its current usage." M.Fowler

Use as a team (2) a virtual server instance to get used with a Continuous Integration System.
